 * requiring quoting, so we derive a deterministic short hex hash and prefix
 * it. Receivers map back to companyId via a Map kept in the transport.
 *
 * Hashing here is purely an identifier-fit for Postgres's 63-byte channel-name
 * cap, NOT a security control. Tenant isolation comes from the WS upgrade
 * gate in `realtime/live-events-ws.ts` (`authorizeUpgrade` rejects
 * connections whose principal does not have membership in the requested
 * company), so the transport trusts the in-process `subscribe(companyId)`
 * call. SHA-256 truncated to 96 bits is collision-safe for any realistic
 * tenant count.
