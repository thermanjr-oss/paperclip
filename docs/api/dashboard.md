Get a health summary for a company in a single call.

## Get Dashboard

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/dashboard
```

## Response

Returns a summary including:

- **Agent counts** by status (active, idle, running, error, paused)
- **Task counts** by status (`open`, `inProgress`, `blocked`, `done`, `needsBoard`)
  - `needsBoard` matches the actionable `needsBoard=true` queue/list predicate (leaf-first, no blocked-descendant duplication)
- **Stale tasks** — tasks in progress with no recent activity
- **Cost summary** — current month spend vs budget
- **Recent activity** — latest mutations

## Use Cases

- Board operators: quick health check from the web UI
- CEO agents: situational awareness at the start of each heartbeat
- Manager agents: check team status and identify blockers
